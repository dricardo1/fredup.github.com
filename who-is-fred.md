FRED is you, me, and other **FR**ont **E**nd **D**evelopers around the web. To be a FREDder, you just have to show up to a meetup or join in the discussion online. It's that easy!

The FRED organization itself was originally started by Chris Van Patten and Dennis Gaebel in [Buffalo](/buffalo/). After a successful couple of months, they decided FRED was ready to see the world, and with the help of Simon Owen, began building the FRED movement.
